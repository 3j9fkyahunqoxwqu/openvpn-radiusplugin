radiusplugin_v1.1a:
- Standard configfile: /etc/openvon/radiusplugin.cnf.
- #include <unistd.h> in IpcSocket.h, is needed for compiling on some systems. 
- Correct README: A configfile must set with "-c configfile".
- Correct fprintf statement in UserAuth.cpp (line 300).
- Set debug level from 7 to 5.

radiusplugin_v1.1.a (5.1.06):
- correct calculate of ipaddress for ifconfig-push in UserAuth::createCcdFile()
- FramedIpAddress-Attribute is set to the IP address OpenVPN is assigned to the client,
	the address is read from ENVP-Array with name ifconfig_pool_remote_ip and set to 
	FramedIpAddress-Attribute at client connect. (radiusplugin.cpp, openvpn_plugin_func_v1(), part: CLIENT_CONNECT)
- suppert for topology option (OpenVPN 2.0.1)
	- read from configfile parameters subnet, p2p
	- add parameters in config with getters, setters and modify constructors and destructor
	- modify UserAuth::createCcdFile to set the right topology option

radiusplugin_1.2:
- use libgcrypt instead openssl (for gpl compability)
- checking of the authenticator field from received packets
- correct error on deleting users without an acct-interim-interval in AcctScheduler.cpp::findUser()
- send message to foreground process if no user was found (else the plugin hangs)

radiusplugin_1.2a:
- correct error if a user connects again, if he is still known by the plugin, now the user can't reconnect if he is known by the plugin
- Change GPL text
- add COPYING file

radiusplugin_1.2b:
- correct error: don't disconnect at rekeying/renegotiation

radiusplugin_1.2c:
- new algorithm to generate Acct-Session-ID, so it should be unique ever, see createSessionID in radiusplugin.cpp

radiusplugin_1.2d:
- option in OpenVPN config file is now: "plugin /etc/openvpn/radiusplugin.so [configfile]
- correct bug: close of configfile was missing

radiusplugin_1.2e:
- use RadiusClass_v1.1a for more machine independance (big endian/little endian)
- use send()/recvInt() instead of sendCode()/recvCode() for internal socket communication

radiusplugin_2.0:
- new features:
	- support of vendor specific attributes with example perl script 
	- support for OpenVPN options: dupliate-cn, client-cert-not-required, username-as-commonname
    - comments allowd in config file
    - parsing of OpenVPN config file for options (see radiusplugin.cnf)
- fixed bugs:
	- crash on rekeying if no radius server respond
	- framed ip is sent in access request packets if the client already has one (at rekeying), for dynamical key assignment through the radius server, so it will not send a new one
	- passwords and sharedsecret are shown as ****** in the logs

radiusplugin_2.0a:
- fix error in IpcSocket.h, 
  bad function name: void IpcSocket::recvBuf(User *) -> void recvBuf(User *);
